#+title: UIOP loading under ECL

This repository demonstrates some strange UIOP loading behaviour from
executables compiled with ECL.

To create such an executable, run:

#+begin_example
ecl --load build.lisp
#+end_example

This will produce a =ecl-uiop= executable. Running it should produce:

#+begin_example
Condition of type: SIMPLE-ERROR
Package ((UIOP/UTILITY . #<UIOP/UTILITY package>)) referenced in compiled file
  NIL
but has not been created
#+end_example
